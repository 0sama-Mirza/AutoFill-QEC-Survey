# AutoFill-QEC-Survey
Saving your time and effort from filling out a useless form forced on us by our university.


## 🧐 Have you ever thought of NOT wasting your time filling out those tedious QEC Survey forms?

Well, look no further because **this Tampermonkey script is here to rescue you**! Say goodbye to the days of agonizing over filling out the absolute wast of time QEC Survey. This script is the superhero you didn’t know you needed (but now can’t live without). It automatically fills in the boring QEC Survey form with random, *yet totally plausible*, answers and submits it for you. Why waste your time when you can waste theirs?

## 🤔 What Does It Do?

- 🛠 **Randomly Selects Radio Buttons:** It groups all radio buttons by name and selects one option from each group (excluding "Select").
- 🔀 **Handles Dropdowns:** It picks a random non-default option for each `<select>` element.
- ✍️ **Fills in Textareas:** Generates random, motivational, and highly professional feedback like *"Excellent," "Satisfactory," and "Informative."* (because who doesn’t love those words?)
- 🚀 **Clicks the Submit Button for You:** Yes, it literally submits the form without breaking a sweat.

## 🚦 How to Use It?

### Step 1: Install a Userscript Manager
First, you need to have a userscript manager like **Tampermonkey** or **Violentmonkey** installed in your browser. If you don’t already have one, here’s where to get it:

- Chrome/Edge: [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
- Firefox: [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- Or search for "Violentmonkey" if you’re feeling rebellious.

### Step 2: Install This Script
- Copy the script from this repo (or directly download it if you're feeling fancy).
- Open your userscript manager.
- Create a new script and paste the code inside.
- Save the script. 🎉

### Step 3: Visit the QEC Survey Page
Go to your university's QEC survey page (or any form you want to automate). The script will detect the form automatically.

### Step 4: Watch the Magic Happen
Once the page loads, the script will:

1. Randomly fill in radio buttons, dropdowns, and textareas.
2. Click the "Submit Proforma" button for you.
3. Make you question why you ever filled these forms manually in the first place.

## 👨‍💻 Why Did I Make This?

University life is stressful enough. Do we really need to spend time filling out these repetitive QEC forms? **No. We do not.** This script is my rebellion against inefficiency, and I hope it saves you as much time as it has saved me.
